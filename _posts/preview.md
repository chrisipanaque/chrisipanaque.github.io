Everyone has problems. But not everyone knows how to solve them. This was the problem that faced David, a software engineer who felt like he was not good at problem solving. He would get stuck on small details and feel overwhelmed by the task at hand.

He decided to take a different approach. He learned how to not be scared of hard problems. He practiced tackling difficult challenges head-on. And eventually, he became an expert at problem solving.

Now, David is able to take on any challenge that comes his way. Whether it's finding a solution to a complex technical issue or simply debugging code, he knows how to get the job done.
