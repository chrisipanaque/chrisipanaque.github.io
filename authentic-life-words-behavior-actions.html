    <h1>Live an authentic life by aligning your words with your behavior.</h1>
    <p>
      The values you live by are not meant to be passive, but should be multiple
      actions that create your behavior. This behavior is what determines who
      you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your behavior doesn't align with your core values, you will
      consistently make decisions on who you are not, instead, take actions that
      align with your words, which will bring long term results that came from
      your habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will make mistakes along the way, but just make sure to have a clear
      vision and purpose of your goals, and you're always striving to align your
      words, actions, behaviour and habits to acomplish those goals.
