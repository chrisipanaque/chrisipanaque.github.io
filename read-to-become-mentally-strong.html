    <h1>Read these 21 phrases every morning to become mentally strong.</h1>
    <p>
      Mental strength, as any other skill, can be developed with practice. It is
      the daily practice of pushing yourself to grow stronger, maintaining
      realistic optimism, and setting healthy boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid wasting time feeling sorry for yourself or giving up control of your
      emotions to others. Instead, gain control of your emotions and become a
      stronger and better person than you were yesterday.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Face the fears that hold you back.</h2>
    <p>
      While you don't need to conquer fears because you have something to prove
      to others, strive to face the fears that hold you back.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Choose productive behavior.</h2>
    <p>
      While it may be tempting to make excuses, complain about other people or
      avoid difficult circumstances, refuse to waste time on unproductive
      activities.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Feel confident in your ability to adapt to change.</h2>
    <p>
      Although change is uncomfortable, it's tolerable. Focus your energy on
      adapting to change, rather than resisting it.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Balance emotions with logic.</h2>
    <p>
      Understand how your emotions can influence your thinking in an effort to
      make the best decisions possible.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Learn from your mistakes.</h2>
    <p>Don't hide or excuse your mistakes. Instead, learn from them.</p>
    <h2>6. Balance self-acceptance with self-improvement.</h2>
    <p>
      Accept yourself for who you are, while simultaneously recognizing your
      need for personal development.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Genuinely celebrate other people's success.</h2>
    <p>
      Cooperate and collaborate, rather than compete with those around you.
      Don't feel as though other people's success somehow diminishes your own
      achievements.
    </p>
    <h2>8. Be comfortable living according to your values.</h2>
    <p>
      Make decisions based on understanding of your priorities and the values
      you live by.
    </p>
    <h2>9. Focus on sharpening your skills, rather than showing them off.</h2>
    <p>
      While some people seek validation from others, avoid being concerned about
      gaining recognition. Instead, focus on staying inspired and motivated to
      become better.
    </p>
    <h2>10. Live an authentic life.</h2>
    <p>
      Be true to yourself. Your words have to be aligned with your behavior.
    </p>
    <h2>11. View life's hardships as opportunities for growth.</h2>
    <p>
      While hardship causes some people to grow bitter, learn from the adversity
      you faced, which made you a better person today.
    </p>
    <h2>12. Your self-worth depends on who you are, not what you achieve.</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you win or lose, your decisions, personality and life values makes
      who you are.
    </p>
    <h2>13. Practice delayed gratification.</h2>
    <p>
      View your goals as a marathon, not a sprint. Be willing to tolerate
      short-term pain when it can provide long-term gain.
    </p>
    <h2>14. Accept personal responsibility for your choices.</h2>
    <p>
      Indecision carries doubts about the outcomes of our decisions and fear of
      failure. After making a decision, accept complete responsibility for your
      actions.
    </p>
    <h2>15. Bounce back from failure.</h2>
    <p>
      Don't view failure as the end of your journey. Instead, use your failed
      attempts as learning opportunities where you gained knowledge, which will
      increase your chances of success in the future.
    </p>
    <h2>16. Engage in active problem-solving.</h2>
    <p>Don't dwell on problems, create solutions instead.</p>
    <h2>17. Express gratitude.</h2>
    <p>
      Rather than exclaim you need more, acknowledge you have more than you
      need, and appreciate all that is around you.
    </p>
    <h2>18. Focus on what you can control.</h2>
    <p>
      Devote and focus all your resources to the things you can control. Do not
      waste it on things you can't.
    </p>
    <h2>19. Be open to learning more from all that surrounds you.</h2>
    <p>
      Constantly learn from your circumstances, and the people you encounter
      every day.
    </p>
    <h2>20. Work on your weaknesses, rather than masking them.</h2>
    <p>
      Do not waste your resources to disguise your vulnerabilities, instead,
      invest all of your energy into improving yourself.
    </p>
    <h2>21. Be a realistic optimist.</h2>
    <p>
      Always maintain a positive attitude. Bring hope and display confidence in
      all of your hard work but don't allow your optimistic tendencies derive
      you from focusing on the problems you are currently facing.
